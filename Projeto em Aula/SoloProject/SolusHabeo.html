        <h2>The Life Of The Penguins:</h2>
        <article>
        <img src="Penguin.jpg">
    <p>Penguins for the most part breed in large colonies, the exceptions being the yellow-eyed and Fiordland
        species; these colonies may range in size from as few as 100 pairs for gentoo penguins to several hundred
        thousand in the case of king, macaroni and chinstrap penguins. Living in colonies results in a high
        level of social interaction between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual as well as vocal
        displays in all penguin species. Agonistic displays are those intended to confront or drive off, or
        alternately appease and avoid conflict with, other individuals.<br>

        Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies
        drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, although the two largest species, the emperor and the
        king penguins, lay only one. With the exception of the emperor penguin, where the male does it all, all
        penguins share the incubation duties. These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member
        of the pair feeds at sea.<br>

        Penguins generally only lay one brood; the exception is the little penguin, which can raise two or three
        broods in a season.<br>

        Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the
        parent birds; at 52 g (2 oz), the little penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450 g (1 lb)
        emperor penguin egg is 2.3%.  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a
        penguin egg, presumably to reduce the effects of dehydration and to minimize the risk of breakage in an
        adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large and comprises 22–31% of the egg. Some yolk often
        remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain the chick if the parents are delayed in
        returning with food.<br>

        When emperor penguin mothers lose a chick, they sometimes attempt to "steal" another mother's chick, usually
        unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In
        some species, such as emperor and king penguins, the chicks assemble in large groups called crèches.</p>
        </article>
    <p>Penguins have no special fear of humans and will often approach groups of people. This is probably because
        penguins have no land predators in Antarctica or the nearby offshore islands. They are preyed upon by other
        birds like skuas, especially in eggs and as fledglings. Other birds like petrels, sheathbills, and gulls
        also eat the chicks. Dogs preyed upon penguins while they were allowed in Antarctica during the age of early
        human exploration as sled dogs, but dogs have long since been banned from Antarctica. Instead, adult
        penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as sharks, orcas, and leopard seals. Typically, penguins do
        not approach closer than around 9 feet (2.7 meters), at which point they appear to become nervous.<br>

        In June 2011, an emperor penguin came ashore on New Zealand's Peka Peka Beach, 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi)
        off course on its journey to Antarctica. Nicknamed Happy Feet, after the film of the same name, it was
        suffering from heat exhaustion and had to undergo a number of operations to remove objects like driftwood
        and sand from its stomach.[96] Happy Feet was a media sensation, with extensive coverage on TV and the web,
        including a live stream that had thousands of views and a visit from English actor Stephen Fry. Once
        he had recovered, Happy Feet was released back into the water south of New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Penguins are widely considered endearing for their unusually upright, waddling gait, swimming ability and
        (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their black-and-white plumage is often likened to a white
        tie suit. Some writers and artists have penguins based at the North Pole, but there are no wild penguins in
        the Arctic. The cartoon series Chilly Willy helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interact
        with Arctic or sub-Arctic species, such as polar bears and walruses.<br>

        Penguins have been the subject of many books and films, such as Happy Feet, Surf's Up and Penguins of
        Madagascar, all CGI films; March of the Penguins, a documentary based on the migration process of the
        emperor penguin; and Farce of the Penguins, a parody of the documentary. Mr. Popper's Penguins is a
        children's book written by Richard and Florence Atwater; it was named a Newbery Honor Book in 1939. Penguins
        have also appeared in a number of cartoons and television dramas, including Pingu, co-created by Otmar
        Gutmann and Erika Brueggemann in 1990 and covering more than 100 short episodes. At the end of 2009,
        Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, saying, "Whether they were walking
        (March of the Penguins), dancing (Happy Feet), or hanging ten (Surf's Up), these oddly adorable birds took
        flight at the box office all decade long."<br>

        A video game called Pengo was released by Sega in 1982. Set in Antarctica, the player controls a penguin
        character who must navigate mazes of ice cubes. The player is rewarded with cut-scenes of animated penguins
        marching, dancing, saluting and playing peekaboo. Several remakes and enhanced editions have followed, most
        recently in 2012. Penguins are also sometimes depicted in music.<br>

        In 1941, DC Comics introduced the avian-themed character of the Penguin as a supervillain adversary of the
        superhero Batman (Detective Comics #58). He became one of the most enduring enemies in Batman's rogues
        gallery. In the 60s Batman TV series, as played by Burgess Meredith, he was one of the most popular
        characters, and in Tim Burton's reimagining of the story, the character played by Danny Devito in the 1992
        film Batman Returns, employed an actual army of penguins (mostly African penguins and king penguins).<br>

        Several pro, minor, college and high school sport teams in the United States have named themselves after the
        species, including the Pittsburgh Penguins team in the National Hockey League and the Youngstown State
        Penguins in college athletics.<br>

        Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of U.K. cartoonist Steve Bell in his strip in The Guardian
        newspaper, particularly during and following the Falklands War. Opus the Penguin, from the cartoons of
        Berkeley Breathed, is also described as hailing from the Falklands. Opus was a comical, "existentialist"
        penguin character in the cartoons Bloom County, Outland and Opus. He was also the star in the animated
        Christmas TV special A Wish for Wings That Work.<br>

        In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting homosexual
        couples. A children's book, And Tango Makes Three, was written about one such penguin family in the New York
        Zoo.</p>
