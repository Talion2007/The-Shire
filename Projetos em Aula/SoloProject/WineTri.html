            <p>About two-thirds of penguin species are listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List, making them one of the
                most endangered seabirds. Loss of habitat, disease, and infectious diseases spread by tourists loom as
                threats. Commercial fishing in the Southern Ocean is also a significant concern, as it has reduced fish
                supply by about half in the Antarctic Peninsula. This forces many penguins to compete for food, and puts
                them in danger of getting accidentally captured by fishing nets.

                Among the biggest threats to penguin populations is climate change. Warming in the polar regions has
                melted sea ice, which penguins depend on to find food and build nests. Rapidly changing conditions mean
                Antarctica could lose most of its penguins to climate change by the end of the century. To survive, they
                may have to relocate to new habitats.</p>
